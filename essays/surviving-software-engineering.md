## Step 1: Just Breathe...

I have officially finished my second week of Software Engineering and my head is spinning.  A couple days into the first week I realized that my planner is not only a pleasantry, but a necessity if I am going to survive this semester.  After a short bout of anxiety, I filled in a couple weeks of my schedule, made a few to do lists, took a deep breathe, and realized that this was going to be FUN.  I'm one of those weird people who thrive off of a busy schedule, high pressure situations and anxiety.

## Step 2: Javascript isn't Java???

Javascript is officially the second programming language I am learning. Up until now I can really only claim proficiency in Java.  Much to my surprise, they are completely different languages, just with similar names.  I'm not sure why the creators did that, but it is quite confusing for the general public.  Luckily though, they have very similar syntax, which is making the learning process fairly smooth.

## Step 3: Work that Brain
So far Javascript seems to be a fairly intuitive language.
