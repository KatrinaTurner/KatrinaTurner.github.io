### In the early 2000s... when every teenager was a professional HTML "coder"

  Early 2000s, picture a teenage girl glued to her computer screen searching for the perfect pink bling background to use on her homepage and a way to play her song on an infinite loop.
  My only prior knowledge on HTML and CSS was styling my Myspace page over a decade ago.  I used to spend hours on end updating my page with all sort of styles and "hacks."  It was fun, but insanely time consuming.  Needless to say, I was dreading the unit on HTML in my software engineering class.  However, it turned out to not be so terrible, mainly thanks to Semantic UI.  My views will be a bit biased because I haven't used bootstrap, or any other fancy UI frameworks, but I am a **FAN!**  It's obviously not perfect, and I will point on some of my frustrations with it, but overall, it just makes life easier, so why wouldn't you love it?  If I knew about this when I had a Myspace... it would have saved me a LOT of time.

### Back to Basics
  For those of you who don't know about HTML and UI Frameworks, imagine you are building a house, from scratch.  First you build the frame of the house, add some walls and roof.  This is plain HTML.  It does the job, but it's not pretty to look at by any means, and it's just basic.  Then you start to decorate, this is CSS.  It makes your site look more aesthitically pleasing.  But imagine trying to decorate and furnish a house... from scratch.  You have to build the furniture & appliances, mix the paint yourself, sew the curtains, etc.  This may seem unnecessary to you.  I mean, that's why we have stores where we can buy all of these things premade.  This is what it is like to program *without* a UI framework.  It's not impossible, but it will take much longer, and it probably won't end up as nice as you wanted because you'll just get tired of it.  Creating every object and layout from scratch is a LOT of work.

### Can't I just buy it?
Let's take it one step further and imagine you spent your whole life making everything from scratch, then one day you discover **Target**.  You discover that *other people* have done a lot of the work for you and you can just buy the things you need instead of making it all yourself.  Going back to the house analogy, now you can truly focus on decorating using all the resources you find at Target instead of making everything from scratch.  It takes a little while to get used to and at first I imagine it would be difficult to find things in the store, which may be a bit frustrating.  Finding the simplest things could end up taking a long time and you may start to get doubtful off if this was even the easier method.  However, in the long run, one you've figured out where everything is in the store, it is obviously the way to go.

### But why Semantic UI?
Now, you may be thinking, Ikea is *way better* than Target for home decor.  This is true, but I don't have access to an IKEA, I only have access to a Target, so that is where I will shop and I will love it.  I would also argue pros and cons to both.  IKEA has more options, but there is usually quite a bit of assembling still required, where as Target has less options, but assembly required is minimal to none.
Just like Semantic UI is the only UI framework I've worked with so of course I love it now, but who knows what other frameworks I will discover and fall in love with on my CS journey.
