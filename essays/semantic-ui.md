### Something clever

  Early 2000s, myspace, html.... blah blah...
  My only prior knowledge on HTML and CSS was styling my Myspace page over a decade ago.  Needless to say, I was dreading the unit on HTML in my software engineering class.  However, it turned out to not be so terrible, mainly thanks to Semantic UI.  My views will be a bit biased because I haven't used bootstrap, or any other fancy UI frameworks, but I am a **FAN!**  It's obviously not perfect, and I will point on some of my frustrations with it, but overall, it just makes life easier, so why wouldn't you love it?
