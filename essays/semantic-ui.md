### In the early 2000s... when every teenager was a professional HTML "coder"

  Early 2000s, myspace, html.... blah blah...
  My only prior knowledge on HTML and CSS was styling my Myspace page over a decade ago.  Needless to say, I was dreading the unit on HTML in my software engineering class.  However, it turned out to not be so terrible, mainly thanks to Semantic UI.  My views will be a bit biased because I haven't used bootstrap, or any other fancy UI frameworks, but I am a **FAN!**  It's obviously not perfect, and I will point on some of my frustrations with it, but overall, it just makes life easier, so why wouldn't you love it?  If I knew about this when I had a Myspace... it would have saved me a LOT of time.

### Back to Basics
  For those of you who don't know about HTML and UI Frameworks, imagine you are building a house, from scratch.  First you build the frame of the house, add some walls and roof.  This is plain HTML.  It does the job, but it's not pretty to look at by any means, and it's just basic.  Then you start to decorate, this is CSS.  It makes your site look more aesthitically pleasing.  But imagine trying to decorate and furnish a house... from scratch.  You have to build the furniture & appliances, mix the paint yourself, sew the curtains, etc.  This may seem unnecessary to you.  I mean, that's why we have stores where we can buy all of these things premade.  This is what it is like to program *without* a UI framework.  It's not impossible, but it will take much longer, and it probably won't end up as nice as you wanted because you'll just get tired of it.
