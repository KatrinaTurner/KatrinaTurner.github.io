## \"But Miss, I thought there was no such thing as stupid questions...\"
A phrase I heard a lot as a teacher, usually following a blank look on my face when a student asked a question I had no clue how to answer.  My reply was generally either, "I just don't know what you're asking me." Or my favorite, "I literally just answered that 2 seconds ago, ask your neighbor."  So for me, [Raymond's article](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) really struck home.  If these students learned even a FEW points from this article about smarter questions, it would make everyone's lives easier.

Going through Stack Overflow, I found a plethora of questions that according to Raymond are not "smart questions."  One of the things he cautions against is being too vague in your title.  This first article I found was simply titled \"[Please help me with this C# code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16509390/please-help-me-with-this-c-sharp-code)\" so it did not come as much of a surprise that it had -2 votes.  They did properly include their code in a box, but their code was so terribly formatted, it was no wonder they were having issues.  It seemed like they got stuck on a problem and instead of debugging, pasted their code into Stack and waited for someone to come save them.  I can definitely see why Raymond says that people are less likely to help someone who posts questions like this.


## \"I don't want to sound stupid..."\
I have found that this is the number one reason students (including myself) DON'T ask questions.  Articles like this, while perhaps a bit harsh, are potentially very helpful for these students as well.  Having confidence that your question is valid is a huge step towards knowing how to get the help you need.

An example I found on Stack Overflow that seemed to fit Raymond's description of a good question was simply titled [403 Forbidden vs 401 Unauthorized HTTP responses.
](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3297048/403-forbidden-vs-401-unauthorized-http-responses/6937030#6937030)
