## \"But Miss, I thought there was no such thing as stupid questions...\"
<img class="ui small left rounded floated image" src="../images/stupid-question-challenge.jpg">
A phrase I heard a lot as a teacher, usually following a blank look on my face when a student asked a question I had no clue how to answer.  My reply was generally either, "I just don't know what you're asking me." Or my favorite, "I literally just answered that 2 seconds ago, ask your neighbor."  So for me, [Raymond's article](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) really struck home.  If these students learned even a FEW points from this article about smarter questions, it would make everyone's lives easier.

Going through Stack Overflow, I found a plethora of questions that according to Raymond are not "smart questions."  One of the things he cautions against is being too vague in your title.  This first article I found was simply titled \"[Please help me with this C# code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16509390/please-help-me-with-this-c-sharp-code)\" so it did not come as much of a surprise that it had -2 votes.  They did properly include their code in a box, but their code was so terribly formatted, it was no wonder they were having issues.  It seemed like they got stuck on a problem and instead of debugging, pasted their code into Stack and waited for someone to come save them.  The post also had very little traffic, even though I'm sure other people came across similar problems over the years.  They were lucky enough to get an answer, but no one else will really benefit from it unless they happen to stumble upon this post by sheer luck, or have the same exact question.
I can definitely see why Raymond says that people are less likely to help someone who posts questions like this.  Stack Overflow is not meant to be a personal tutor.


## \"I don't want to sound stupid..."\
I have found that this is the number one reason students (including myself) DON'T ask questions.  Articles like this, while perhaps a bit harsh, are potentially very helpful for these students as well.  Having confidence that your question is valid is a huge step towards knowing how to get the help you need.

An example I found on Stack Overflow that seemed to fit Raymond's description of a good question was simply titled [403 Forbidden vs 401 Unauthorized HTTP responses.
](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3297048/403-forbidden-vs-401-unauthorized-http-responses/6937030#6937030)  I found this title very clear and easily searchable.  Aparently so did a lot of other people because it has been viewed 788,611 times in the last 8 years and has 2109 votes (as of 01-24-2019).  One person even says in the comments \"I don't remember how many times me and my colleagues have come back to stackoverflow for this question.\" The highest ranked answer is very thorough and a useful explanation for anyone with this question.
