<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Hawai'i has so many things to offer when it comes to activities for people to do in their spare time, especially when it comes to outdoor activities.  However, it can be difficult for UH students to take advantage of these if they don't know about them, or don't have transportation.</p>

<p>The idea behind this website would be to create a place where students could form interest groups and organize activities like hiking, climbing, surfing, etc. off campus for students.</p>

<h2>Mockup page ideas</h2>
* Landing Page
* Main Search Page
* Interest Group Pages
* Add Group/Event Page
* Admin Control Page

<h4>Main Search Page</h4>
<p>This page would have postings of upcoming events.  Students could browse through events by interest groups, event date, etc.</p>
  
<h4>Interest Group Pages</h4>
<p>These pages would have more details about upcoming events for that particular interest.  For example, a hiking interest group would have information on upcoming hikes around the island.  Here students could organize a time and place to meet up and maybe even transportation options like carpooling, or sharing an Uber.</p>

<h4>Group/Event Creation Page</h4>
<p>Here users could propose new interest groups or activities to be approved by an admin.</p>

<h2>Use case ideas</h2>
<h5>New user:</h5> 
Landing page --> log in --> set up profile --> Main Search Page
<h5>User:</h5> 
Landing page --> log in --> Main Search Page --> Interest Group Page OR Creation Page
<h5>Admin:</h5> 
Landing page --> log in --> Admin Control Page to edit site


<h2>Beyond the basics</h2>
* Students could also leave "Reviews" of past experiences with tips for future adventurers wanting to repeat that event.
* Allow companies who maybe want to offer group rates or student specials to UHM students to add event ideas.  They would have a different login, or would email admin directly.
