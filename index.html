                        Born and raised in Kāne'ohe, Hawai'i, I received an Bachelors of Education in Secondary Ed:
                        Mathematics from the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa and taught high school math around Oahu,
                        most recently at my Alma Mater, Castle High School.
                        Teaching was an invaluable experience and provided me with the opportunity to give back to
                        my
                        community, but after 7 years I yearned for a career change.
                        I decided to combine my passions for puzzles, logic & creativity and return to school to
                        pursue a Master's degree in Computer Science.
                        <br>
                        I am currently employed at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa’s <a id="link"
                            href="https://www.lavaflow.info/about">Laboratory for Advanced Visualization &
                            Applications
                            (LAVA)</a> under the direction of Dr. Jason Leigh as a Research Assistant.
                        My responsibilities include creating new ways to visualize Internet2 Network flow data for
                        the
                        <a id="link" href="https://www.netsage.global/">NetSage Project.</a>
                        This has helped me develop my skills and passion for software development and visualization.
                        During my time at LAVA I have also been fortunate enough to work with some of the best VR and AR
                        technology, which spawned my interest in that field as well.
                        <br>
                        Outside of work and school, I enjoy playing video games, baking, spending time with my family,
                        dancing hula, and enjoying island life.
                        <br>
                        After graduation, I hope to remain in Hawai'i and find a job either locally or remotely where I
                        can enhance my skills and make an impact in the industry.
