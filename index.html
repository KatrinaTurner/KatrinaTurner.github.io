                    I am studying for a M.S. in Computer Science in the Department of Information and Computer Sciences
                    at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa.
                    <br>
                    I expect to graduate in May 2021.

                    <p>
                        Born and raised in Kaneohe, Hawai'i, I received an Bachelors of Education in Secondary Ed:
                        Mathematics from the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa and taught high school math around Oahu,
                        most recently at my Alma Mater, Castle High School.
                        Teaching was an invaluable experience and provided me with the opportunity to give back to my
                        community, but after 7 years I yearned for a career change.
                        I decided to combine my passions for puzzles, logic & creativity and returned to school to
                        pursue a Master's degree in Computer Science.
                        <br>
                        I am currently employed at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa’s <a id="link"
                            href="https://www.lavaflow.info/about">Laboratory for Advanced Visualization & Applications
                            (LAVA)</a> as a Research Assistant.
                        My responsibilities include creating new ways to visualize Internet2 Network flow data for the
                        <a id="link" href="https://www.netsage.global/">NetSage Project.</a>
                        <br>
                        After graduation, I hope to remain in Hawai'i and find a job where I can pursue my interests of
                        Data Science and Data Visualization.
