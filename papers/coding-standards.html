                Have you ever tried to make sense of someone else's notes and just been completely lost? Which of these
                would you rather
                read?

                I'm guessing you picked the one on the right. When I taught Algebra 2, I was constantly looking over
                students notes and
                work to help them solve problems. I noticed a significant difference in students who kept their work
                neat versus those
                who just scribbled numbers here and there on their paper. First of all, when I asked a student to
                explain their thinking
                process to me, those who had a system for showing their work could easily walk me through, step by step,
                which made it
                easy for me to point out any errors to them. Those who did NOT solve problems systematically would often
                get lost trying
                to explain their process to me and would have to start from scratch. It made such a difference that I
                started requiring
                students to follow certain guidelines when solving equations. You can look at coding in a similar light.
                You are going
                through a logical series of steps to achieve your end goal. So, it naturally follows that coders would
                also benefit from
                adhering to some type of standard for "showing their work" as well.

                In my humble opinion, coding standards are a necessary guideline for anyone who wants to code more than
                a 20-line
                program. The importance of having "neat" code goes far beyond just because it looks nice. Messy code is
                basically
                equivalent to messy handwriting or completely ignoring the lines on folder paper when you‚Äôre writing.
                Similarly, trying
                to read messy code, whether to debug it, or just to understand it is painful at best. So why not avoid
                all that by
                adhering to some coding standards? At first you may find it annoying, painful, or excessive. You may ask
                yourself,
                ‚Äú**WHY** is it necessary to have so many spaces?!‚Äù But overtime, it will become second nature to do
                these things and you
                will reap the benefits. When you‚Äôve been staring at a screen for 6 hours straight, those *spaces* you
                hated so much are
                suddenly making it 10 times easier to read your code. Those indentations make it easier to follow your
                logic from 2 days
                ago and those well-named variables are saving your life because you have no clue what you were thinking
                when you typed
                that code at 1am the night before. And when, God forbid, you have to ask someone for help, they won‚Äôt
                disown you when
                they go through and try to make sense of your code. All of the sudden, Checkstyle and ESLint go from
                pesky
                anal-retentive supervisors to welcome contributors with your best interests at heart.

              <div id="essay-text">
                The moral of the story is, if you hate your coding standards right now, ***stick it out.*** It‚Äôs worth
                it in the end.
                For you and any other poor soul who has to read through your code in the future.
