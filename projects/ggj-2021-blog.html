                            Global Game Jam is completely online this year due to COVID-19 restrictions. Because of
                            that, we have four days to complete our games instead of two. The theme is
                            Lost and Found. Completed our game on time! It was a lot of fun to develop and play! Check
                            back for more updates! <br>

                            We have a team and a game concept... "Lost and Found... in Space!" Let the games begin...
                            <br>
                            But actually, we all have class and work so we can't really start anything till tomorrow.
                            Very successful brainstorming session though. We have lots of fun ideas, lets see how many
                            we can implement by Day 4!

                                Worked on some puzzle logic today. I managed to implement a version of Simon Says today.
                                Didn't have a whole lot of time after school and work. The rules are simple, watch the
                                pattern
                                and repeat it by walking over each colored area. The number of the lights to remember
                                increases as you get closer to the room your friend is in to increase the difficulty. If
                                you get
                                it wrong, it flashes red and repeats the pattern so you can try again. If you get it
                                correct all the lights turn green and the doors open, allowing you to go to the next
                                room.

                            I got a good bit done today! I managed to implement two more puzzles and integrate them into
                            the environment.
                            <br> The first puzzle is a simple levers puzzle (pictured on left). The point of the puzzle
                            is to get all the
                            levers in the up position. When you switch one lever up or down, it also switches the levers
                            directly next to it. The logic was pretty straight forward so I was able to code it pretty
                            quickly. I instantiated the levers in a random start position and through code so the number
                            of levers could be adjusted for varying levels of difficulty.
                            <br> The second puzzle I implemented today was more of a task than a puzzle. The player
                            comes across a key that "explodes" when they touch it and flings pieces around the room to
                            random positions. The player then has to collect them all as quickly as possible to unlock
                            the doors and move to the next room. This one was also fairly straight forward to implement
                            so I was actually able to start implementing the fourth puzzle. It's taking me a while
                            though as it is slightly less trivial.
                            <br>I also added the sprites from our artists and started to test a little bit
                            of game play.

                            Luckily we have a babysitter today because its the LAST DAY! Lots of work to do still. I
                            have to finish implementing the fourth puzzle and finish adding them all in to the main
                            scene.

                            <h4 class="ui header">**UPDATE**</h3>
                                We finished our game! Today I learned about using Slowdamp instead of Lerp/Slerp for
                                moving Game Objects around and it may be my new favorite thing!
                                <br> We were putting finishing touches on right up to the last second, but we got it
                                done. There are a few things we missed here and there and some functionality we didn't
                                get a chance to implement, but we produced a fun, playable game in just a few days,
                                which is the whole point anyway, right?

                            Overall this was a great experience for me. We had a great team and I got to really put my
                            Unity skills to the test. I learned a lot of new things and have a cool project to add to my
                            repertoire. Here are some more pictures from the final game!
