                                Accreditation is a 2-3 year process that all schools must go through every 10 years or
                                so to essentially make sure
                                they
                                are doing their job as a school. While I was a teacher at Castle High School, the time
                                came for us to go through
                                this
                                grueling process. The entire faculty and staff were split into about 5 teams to work on
                                each section of our
                                accreditation write up and I was chosen to be the technology leader for one of the
                                teams.

                                The accreditation process was obviously not a new thing for the school and some of the
                                more seasoned teachers
                                had been
                                through many successful accreditations in their career. However, this was the first time
                                they did the entire
                                process
                                electronically instead of creating a giant binder hard copy. Therefore, my knowledge of
                                Google Drive and Google
                                Apps are
                                what got me appointed Tech Team Leader.
                                My main responsibilities included leading meetings, formatting the document, training
                                teachers on uploading &
                                linking
                                resources, and most importantly, maintaining the resource folders and making sure all
                                the links worked.

                                This was overall one of the largest projects I've ever been a part of. Because the
                                project stretched over 2 school years, time management was a huge part of making sure
                                everything got done on time. One thing I found challenging was that I was the youngest
                                teacher and had never been
                                through the process before, but I still had act in a leadership position. Getting older,
                                more seasoned teachers to adhere to my deadlines, was not always the easiest and
                                required a lot of emails, reminders, and
                                sometimes begging on my part. One thing I enjoyed was getting to share my knowledge
                                about Google Docs with teachers
                                who don't usually use a lot of technology in their classrooms. I think I inspired some
                                of them to incorporate more technology in their every day classes, not just the
                                accreditation process. It was also
                                really exciting to be part of the first completely paperless accreditation portfolio.
