                A final project for my Machine Learning and Data Science. I used grades and various background info on
                students to create a model that predicts whether a student would be successful in Algebra 2.

                            This was my final project for my Machine Learning and Data Science classes.
                            I chose this project because it addressed a very real problem I had when I was a math
                            teacher: will this student be successful in Algebra 2? This may seem like a trivial
                            question, but in Hawai'i public schools, Algebra 2 is the first "elective" math course that
                            students take. Historically, it also has a pretty high fail rate.
                            <br>
                            I would like to point out early on that this is in NO WAY meant to be a replacement for a
                            teacher's opinion, because it is well established that teachers generally know their
                            students best and most could easily answer this question for you. However, we live in a
                            world where everybody wants to see the "data" to back up these opinions.
                            I used grades and various background data on students to create a model that predicts
                            whether a student would be successful in Algebra 2.
                            <br>
                            Fortunately, I was able to get data from the high school I used to teach at. This was a
                            great opportunity for me to work with real data and go through the entire pipeline of
                            cleaning & processing the data to training models on it.
                            It was not a large enough data set to do any neural networks, but I was
                            able to train a fairly accurate decision tree. One of the most interesting observations from
                            the data was that a student's overall GPA had the highest effect on their probability of
                            success. This may seem like an obvious statement, but in my model overall GPA had a higher
                            weight than their "Math GPA" or Algebra 1 grade. Thus inferring that its not just whether a
                            student is "good at math," but whether they are an overall successful student that
                            determines
                            their success in Algebra 2.

                            <br>
                            I gave my model back to the math department for them to use with future students with the
                            hope that it would be a useful tool for them to "show the math" to back their decisions.
