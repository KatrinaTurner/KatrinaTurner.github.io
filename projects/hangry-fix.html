                    For my final project for Software Engineering, I worked with a team to develop a Web App that would
                    help alleviate
                    hangriness on UH Manoa's campus.

                                As the final project for Software Engineering, we were tasked to create a Web App that
                                would benefit our campus(UH
                                Manoa) in some way. We chose to create an app called hangryFIX that is similar to Yelp,
                                but is focused on the actual
                                food items, rather than restaurants since that is generally more important when you are
                                really hungry. I worked on a
                                team of 3 and we used GitHub to manage and code our project. The app itself is a Meteor
                                app and we used React Semantic
                                UI as a tool to write it.

                                My main contributions to the project were the Landing, Sign-up, and Admin pages, as well
                                as user testing once we were
                                close to completion.

                                The Landing page was the most fun to create because that is the first thing people see
                                when they visit our site. We
                                decided upon the general layout as a group, but I got to implement everything, choose
                                the pictures, create the write
                                ups, etc.

                                The Admin page was the most interesting to create because I had to think about what
                                types of things a site admin might
                                want to access. I had to dynamically pull data from almost all our collections and put
                                them into something worthwhile.
                                This was also the most challenging to add functionality to. I had to be creative in the
                                way I was filtering the data
                                from the collections, but I enjoyed the challenge and it was very satisfying to see it
                                work in the end.

                                Overall, this is probably one of the better experiences I've had working on a team. The three of us had a really good
                                group dynamic. No one was over zealous or lazy, everyone just wanted to put out a good product. Work got done,
                                communication was always open, and we had a lot of fun. I feel very fortunate because I know this is not always the case
                                when placed into groups for software development.
                                
                                The thing that took us the most getting used to was to actually use the project boards on GitHub. But in the end it
                                became more natural and actually ended up saving us a great deal of time because I could easily locate a previous branch
                                I needed to pull code from at the last minute.
                                
                                
                                By the end of the project I think I definitely grew a lot stronger as a developer through lots of trial and error with
                                different React elements. I was thrilled with the positive feedback we got from our user testing and I am excited to try
                                out my new skills in the months/years to come.
