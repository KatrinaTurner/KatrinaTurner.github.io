                            The general concept of the game is that you are a being made of light in a world of darkness
                            so you can only see the area immediately around you.
                            You must collect energy crystals to fuel your light attacks to defeat the boss without
                            getting hit. As you the boss loses health, his attacks become stronger and more frenzied in
                            an attempt to defeat you.
                            To balance his increasing attacks, you become faster and your light gets stronger, allowing
                            you to see a little more area around you every time you deal him damage.
