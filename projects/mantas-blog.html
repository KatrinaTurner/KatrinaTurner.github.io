                    As the final project for Data Visualization, my team created a website dedicated to visualizing data
                    on Manta Ray sightings in Kﾄ］e'ohe Bay.

                                As the final project for Data Visualization, we were tasked with choosing a data set we
                                found interesting and creating useful visualizations for it. One of my team members was
                                a Marine Biologist and had a personal data set on Manta Ray sightings in Kﾄ］e'ohe Bay
                                that we found interesting so we decided to use it for our project. The idea was to build
                                a site that he can continue to add data to over time.
                                We focused on answering three main questions with our visualizations:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>When are we most likely to see manta rays? (Day/Time)</li>
                                    <li>Where are we most likely to see the manta rays in the bay?</li>
                                    <li>Who are the manta rays that live in the bay?</li>
                                </ul>
                                <br>
                                We cleaned and processed the data in Python, then used various javascript libraries for
                                the visualizations, including Plotly.js, D3, and Leaflet.

                                <img class="ui large rounded left floated image" src="../images/manta-when.png"
                                    style="margin-right: 20px;">
                                This project team consisted of myself, another Computer Scientist and a Marine
                                Biologist. My main contributions to the project were the "When" page and styling the UI,
                                the other computer scientist and I worked together to clean and parse the data in
                                Python.
                                <br>
                                The question being answered on the "When" page is "When are they around?" or "When is
                                the best time to spot a manta ray in the bay?" The first two plots on the page are basic
                                polar plots that show the number of mantas spotted by lunar day and daily tidal phase.
                                Each dot represents a day that mantas were spotted. It's angle represents what day in
                                the lunar calendar (or tidal phase in the day) and the distance from the center
                                represents the number of mantas spotted on that day. I chose this visualization because
                                it is easy to see at a glance which days and tidal phases are associated with higher
                                manta sightings. I created these using the plotly.js library.
                                The third visual on the page is a heatmap calendar that I created using D3. It
                                aggregates all the manta sightings by lunar day and uses the average number of mantas
                                sighted on that lunar day to create a heatmap overlayed on a 4 week calendar. The
                                calendar automatically shows the current week plus the next three weeks. I thought this
                                would be an easy way for viewers to tell when the next "good" days for spotting mantas
                                would be since most people don't just know what lunar day it is.

                                I really enjoyed working on this project. I always enjoy the chance to be creative and I
                                think we came up with some interesting visualizations. I also appreciated the chance to
                                work with
                                real data and that we had a real "customer" to build for. Getting to work with the
                                domain scientist who cultivated the data was really helpful in making meaningful
                                visualizations. It was also helpful that he had a pretty clear idea of what he wanted to
                                get out of it.
